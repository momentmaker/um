# surrender

life is an amazing thing.

it's a beautifully orchestrated play we observe through our 5 senses as electrical conduit to the real us.

my journey in life has taught me to let go and just serve the moment that unfolds in front of me with all my heart and soul.

the moment in front of us is an immutable chain of events that stemmed from the beginning of Creation.

how can we not honor it?

i have no idea where life is guiding me but I'm curious to find out as i surrender to whatever she is hinting at me

whatever it is, i am committed to do my best to serve what is asked of me.

how can i help to serve the ever unfolding dance of life?
