* all of man's troubles arise because he cannot sit in a room quietly by himself
* easy choices, hard life; hard choices, easy life
* the modern struggle: lone individual summoning inhuman willpower, fasting, meditating and exercising - up against armies of scientists and statisticians weaponizing abundant food, screens and medicine into junk food, clickbait news, infinite porn, endless games and addictive drugs

* contemplation is precisely the awareness that this ‘I’ is really ‘not I’ and the awakening of the unknown ‘I’ that is beyond observation and reflection and is incapable of commenting upon itself
* when I look within and see that I am nothing, that is wisdom; when I look without and see that I am everything, that is love; between these two, my life turns
* carefully observe the way your heart draws you and then choose that way with all your strength
* eigenzeit - the time inherent to a process itself; the relentless pressure to be efficient at work, and outside it, is wearing us all down
* when the shoe fits, the foot is forgotten; when the belt fits, the belly is forgotten; and when the heart is right, 'for' and 'against' are forgotten
* when one is angry, if one can directly forget his anger and examine the right and wrong according to principle, then right and wrong will be clearly seen and desires will naturally be unable to persist
