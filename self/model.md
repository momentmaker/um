## what attracts women

* **status** - behavior instead of actual
* **desire to be desired** - paradox of pursue and non-caring

## emotional neediness

neediness is a huge turn-off for women

they can sniff them out quickly in a man

## power in vulnerability

vulnerability is the path of true human connection and becoming a truly attractive person

showing desire is a vulnerability and short-circuits the paradox

when desire is shown without neediness, it is attractive

## gift of truth

be honest with your intention

cannot fake vulnerability, cannot fake truth - truth has to be a gift, given with no conditions or expectations

it all comes down to what is being sub-communicated

when in doubt, check your intentions

set boundaries for yourself but not others

**friction** - she finds you attractive but external circumstances prevent her from taking actions

**projection** - she projects her own trust issues and resentments on to you

## polarization

3 types of women:

* receptive - already attracted to you; respond positively to your advances
* neutral - polarize them in order get them to decide - this is basically game
* unreceptive - give up; don't bother

## rejection and success

majority of the times (95%) women are going to reject you - it's usually not about you

think of it as a treasure hunt for the 5% women who are attracted to you

attitude of "_i wonder what she's like_" / "_i wonder if we'll have an adventure together_"

**success = maximizing happiness with whichever women we prefer**

## three fundamentals

* creating an attractive and appealing lifestyle (honest living)
* overcoming your fears and anxiety around women (honest action)
* mastering the expression of your emotions and communicating fluidly (honest communication)

### honest living

demographic: like attracts like

go where your interest lies

our beliefs are reflected in our behavior, and behavior determines which women are attract to us

screening women through your personal beliefs is incredibly powerful

1. the assumption that woman is attracted to you
2. women playing games or are "testing" you

**assume attraction; assume they don't play games**

age, money and looks do matter but don't matter as much as most guys think

the more money/looks/success you have, the less attractive behavior you need; the less money/looks/success you have, the more attractive behavior you need.

ditch the any sort of rating scale for women - it's a subtle and unconscious way of putting women on a pedestal and therefore over-investing yourself and become needy

use binary system instead - 1 or 0

treat the 1% women like she's just a normal human being

your life and everything that it encompasses, is a reflection of your emotional investment in yourself

the more invested you are in yourself, the less needy you are with others

fashion and fitness are the easiest to change within your control

body language and vocal tonality

how to be fascinating - being well-read, developing artistic taste, trying new things, and having opinions

### honest action

how many bullshit stories do you tell yourself for not taking action

**defense mechanism**

* fear of approaching and starting a conversation with an attractive woman
* fear of stating sexual interest either directly or indirectly
* fear of initiating sexual contact
* fear of actual sexual intercourse

**excuse pattern**

* blame game
* apathy and avoidance
* intellectualizing

take full responsibility and accountability of your results and your actions

give up porn and masturbate only once a week with women you've met but haven't had sex with

the way to attack anxieties is through incremental, but high volume exposure

feeling fear and acting despite of it builds courage

acknowledge interrupting social norms if taking bold actions

always err on the side of aggression
