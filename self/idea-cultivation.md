# idea cultivation

* go for a walk
* cultivate hunches
* write everything down but keep your folders messy
* embrace serendipity
* make generative mistakes
* take on multiple hobbies
* frequent coffeehouses and other liquid networks
* follow the links
* let others build on your ideas
* borrow, recycle, reinvent
* build a tangled bank
