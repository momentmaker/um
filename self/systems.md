# systems

1. systems in general work poorly or not at all
2. new systems generate new problems
3. the total amount of anergy in the universe is constant
4. systems tend to grow, and as they grow, they encroach
5. systems display antics
6. complex systems tend to oppose their own proper function
7. people in systems do not do what the system says they are doing
8. the system itself does not do what it says it is doing
9. things are what they are reported to be
10. systems attract systems-people
11. the bigger the system, the narrower and more specialized the interface with individuals
12. a complex system cannot be "made" to work. it either works or it doesn't
13. a simple system, designed from scratch, sometimes works
14. some complex systems actually work
15. a complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that works
16. a complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. you have to start over, beginning with a working simple system
17. in complex systems, malfunction and even total non-function may not be detectable for long periods, if ever
18. large complex systems are beyond human capacity to evaluate
19. a system that performs a certain function or operates in a certain way will continue to operate in that way regardless of the need or of changed conditions
20. systems develop goals of their own the instant they come into being
21. intra-system goals come first
22. complex systems usually operate in failure mode
23. a complex system can fail in an infinite number of ways
24. the mode of failure of a complex system cannot ordinarily be predicted from its structure
25. the crucial variables are discovered by accident
26. the larger the system, the greater the probability of unexpected failure
27. "success" or "function" in any system may be failure in the larger or smaller systems to which the systems is connected
28. when a fail-safe system fails, it fails by failing to fail safe
29. complex systems tend to produce complex responses (not solutions) to problems
30. great advances are not produced by systems designed to produce great advances
31. systems run better when designed to run downhill
32. loose systems last longer and work better
