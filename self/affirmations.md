# affirmations

God is my unfailing supply, and large sums of money come to me quickly, under grace, in perfect ways

every plan my Father in heaven has not planned, shall be dissolved and dissipated, and the Divine Idea now comes to pass

only that which is true of God is true of me, for i and the Father are ONE

as i am with God, i am one with my good, for God is both the Giver and the Gift. i cannot separate the Giver from the Gift

Divine Love now dissolves and dissipates every wrong condition in my mind, body and affairs. Divine Love is the most powerful chemical in the universe, and dissolves everything which is not of itself

Divine Love floods my consciousness with health, and every cell in my body is filled with light

my eyes are God's eyes, i see with my eyes of spirit. i see clearly the open way; there are no obstacles on my pathway. i see clearly the perfect plan

i am divinely sensitive to my intuitive leads, and give instant obedience to Thy will

my ears are God's ears, i hear with ears of spirit. i am nonresistant and am willing to be led. i hear glad tidings of great joy

i have perfect work in a perfect way; i give a perfect service for perfect pay

i cast this burden on the Christ within, and i go free!
