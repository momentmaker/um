# yoga sutras

1.  **now, instruction in yoga begins**

    > “now” is not chronological—it’s initiatic. it means: _you’ve suffered enough_, _you’ve desired enough_, _you’re ready to remember_. only _then_ is yoga possible.
    >
    >
    >
    > this is the entry into _Sāttwa_, the pure discriminative stage of spiritual science. not philosophy—_science_. yoga is to be _practiced_, not theorized.
2.  yoga is the cessation of the whirlpools of consciousness

    > the soul is _reflected_ in the lake of the mind. when the lake is still, the _Self_ is visible. yoga isn’t escape—it’s _union with Self_ via stillness. kriya breathwork purifies the chitta and slows the vṛttis.
    >
    >
    >
    > vṛttis are rooted in attraction and repulsion (the dual electricities of creation). to neutralize them is to _repolarize_ attention back to the divine center.
3.  then the seer rests in their own true nature

    > your real nature is _ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new bliss_. when thought ceases, you _are_ that. this is the goal of _samadhi_, attained through _superconscious stillness_
    >
    >
    >
    > svarūpa is not an abstraction—it is the _causal self_, beyond astral and gross. resting in it is _realization_
4.  otherwise, the seer identifies with the modifications

    > this is _maya_. identifying with the body, emotion, thought = spiritual amnesia. you think you are the storm instead of the sky
    >
    >
    >
    > this is the soul’s _delusion_—its fall into nature’s triple qualities (gunas). from oneness into form
5.  there are five kinds of thought-modifications—some painful, some not

    > all thoughts aren’t evil—but even _positive vṛttis_ veil the self. only _superconscious_ waves point inward
    >
    >
    >
    > the fivefold modifications align with the five sheaths (_koshas_) and must be _transcended_, not merely balanced
6.  the five types: correct knowledge, error, imagination, sleep, memory

    > all are _vṛttis_—movements in the lake of mind. even right knowledge is a ripple. ultimate yoga = the _stilling_ of even pramāṇa
    >
    >
    >
    > only pure intuition (viveka) transcends these. all else is part of the _manasic illusion_
7.  right knowledge comes from perception, inference, and testimony

    > perception (eyes), inference (logic), and authority (scripture) are helpful—but still limited. highest _pramāṇa_ is _direct soul perception_
    >
    >
    >
    > scripture is valid only when it aligns with inner realization. never bow to dogma—_verify within_
8.  error is false knowledge based on a mistaken object

    > this is ego believing it’s the body. mistaking maya for reality. error = soul _misidentifying_ itself with mind, senses, and world
    >
    >
    >
    > all false knowledge is rooted in _aviveka_ (lack of discrimination)—this is the foundation of reincarnation
9.  imagination is verbal knowledge without substance

    > all concepts without _experience_ are empty. imagining God is not _knowing_ God
    >
    >
    >
    > mental speculation is dust. only _realization_ counts
10. sleep is a vṛtti based on absence

    > sleep isn’t unconsciousness—it’s a subtle form of _ego withdrawal_. but not samadhi. a yogi must transcend sleep—not escape into it
    >
    >
    >
    > in dreamless sleep, the _ego dissolves_ into causal body—but still unaware. samadhi = same dissolution, _with awareness_
11. memory is recollection of past experience

    > memory is both blessing and curse. it can bind you to old karma—or remind you of your divinity
    >
    >
    >
    > memories are impressions (_samskaras_) in the astral brain. true yoga burns them _completely_
12. the vṛttis are stilled by practice and non-attachment

    > _abhyāsa_ = meditative discipline; _vairāgya_ = inner disinterest in maya. both are wings. kriya yoga IS this: effort + letting go
    >
    >
    >
    > this is the _science_ of reversal—from outward to inward. detachment isn’t passivity—it’s clarity
