# managing oneself

### what are my strengths?

* feedback analysis - identify and concentrate on your strengths / avoid intellectual ignorance
* lack of manners

### how do I perform?

* reader or listener?
* how do I learn?
* loner or work well with people?
* decision maker or advisor?
* perform well under stress or structured environment?
* big or small organization?
* do not try to change yourself - work hard to improve the way you perform

### what are my values?

* the "mirror test" - what kind of person do I want to see in the morning
* value match that of the company?
* strength-performance rarely conflict; but value-strength might conflict

### where do I belong?

* most people won't know where they belong until past 20's
* but they should have know the answers to the questions above
* decide where they do not belong

### what should I contribute?

* knowledge workers are different and needs to ask this question
* three distinct elements:
  * what does the situation require?
  * given my strengths, my way of performing and my values, how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done?
  * what results have to be achieved to make a difference?
