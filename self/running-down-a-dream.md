# running down a dream

## find your passion

* pick a craft about which you have deep personal interest
* this should be your personal passion

## hone your craft

* be obsessively curious about your field; consider your obligation to learn everything you can about it
* study the history of the field as well as the field's pioneers
* it isn't always easy to be the smartest or the brightest, but it's very doable to be the most knowledgable
* you might need to go to the place where the craft is most practiced

## develop mentors in your field

* take every chance you can to meet people that are known for success in the field you have chosen
* try to have these mentors interested in your development and success
* this is not just at the beginning of your career, but all the way through the end of your career

## embrace peer relationships in your field

* develop deep relationships with peers that are on the same journey
* always share best practices, don't worry about proprietary advantage
* celebrate their accomplishments a if they were your own
* peers don't need to be in the exact same field

## always be gracious and humble

* always give the majority of the credit to the mentors and peers that helped you along the way
* send letters,  send gifts, send tweets; show appreciation
* eventually become the mentor for others that are coming up the ladder
