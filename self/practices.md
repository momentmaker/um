***

* question every desire to see whether it's really yours or it's memetic
* invert your goals to become anti-goals
* alternate nostril breathing to disrupt desire energy patterns
* finish what you start to build your willpower
* once the road is known, even when no one walks with you, walk like a man and go on alone
* don't try to change the old energy; instead, create a new energy vortex
* allow yourself to be yourself; others to be others
* do only what is effortless, easy, enjoyable
* do what works; do what is right
