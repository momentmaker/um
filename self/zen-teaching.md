# zen teaching

1. learn how to be entirely unreceptive to sensations arising from external forms, thereby purging your bodies of receptivity to externals
2. learn not to pay attention to any distinction between this and that arising from your sensations, thereby purging your bodies of useless discernments between one phenomenon and another
3. take great care to avoid discriminating in terms of pleasant and unpleasant sensations, thereby purging your bodies of vain discriminations
4. avoid pondering things in your mind, thereby purging your bodies of discriminatory cognition
