# business words of wisdom

* ownership is EVERYTHING!
* persist, don't give up, do change track if on wrong track
* believe in yourself and believe in your journey
* trust your instincts. be a predator. attack when instincts scream. trust your judgment when it calls
* diversify your baskets. in the beginning, related to your core business if you can
* listen and listen. do it continuously
* prepare yourself for luck, but don't seek her out. let her come to you
* make your own luck
* don't whine or ever describe yourself as 'unlucky'
* be bold. be brave. don't thank your lucky stars - they can't hear you
* stay the course. stop looking for the green grass over the hill
* don't try to do it all yourself. delegate and teach other to delegate
* remember that most predators are lucky most of their lives, unlike their prey
* whiners and cowards die a hundred times a day. be a hero to yourself
* if being a hero isn't your style, then fake it - reality will catch up
* just do it. it is much easier to apologize than to obtain permissions
* never take the quest for wealth seriously - just a game, chum
* next time you bump into Lady Luck, smack her ass
* be lucky. get rich. then give it all away
* the fortress that parlays in already half taken
* build your own successful business first before going into partnership
