# effective employer

1. the vital thing is that those who work under you share your basic ideals and spirit. concentrate on working with those who are willing, supportive, cheerful, and loyal.
2. realize and accept that each person may also have a personal agenda, and is working out his own karma. avoid both superiority and inferiority complexes, for they prevent one from expanding into a greater reality.
3. don't be afraid to test people - especially before you give them a position of importance. keep a calm center in your heart from which you look out impartially upon the world and other people. never judge, but don't encourage in anyone the thought that he can easily fool you.
4. a leader cannot afford to be too easily influenced by emotions, whether his own or those of other people.
5. before you employ anyone, consider his attitude more even than his capabilities.
6. if someone you've hired proves to be unwilling or unable to tune into the group spirit, he should simply not be given too much energy. don't waste time in excessive effort to win him over.
7. if someone turn against you or betrays the friendship, don't let anger poison your heart. continue to be their friend - in your heart, at least.
8. the people you serve are the final test of whatever you produce, but your first loyalty should be to your staff.
9. lead; never drive
10. an important part of your job is to encourage creativity in others. give as much credit to others as possible.
11. have an agenda for your stuff meeting, and make sure everyone follows it. make a proposal, and then invite suggestions.
12. the extent to which you need to make clear the fact that you are the boss, as opposed to being everyone's friend, cannot be written into any system of rules. many issues must be resolved intuitively.
13. if others do not clearly perceive you as the one in charge, the work force itself may lack any real discipline. on the other hand, if you rule with too heavy a hand, people will cease to respect you.
14. the most important rule for you is to be always centered in yourself - in the spine. visualize yourself as relating to others from your center to their center. treat everyone equally, as expressions of God.
