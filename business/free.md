# free

## open-source model

1. build a community around free information and advice on a particular topic
2.  with that community‘s help, design some products that people want, and return the favor

    by making the products free in raw form
3.  let those with more money than time/skill/risk-tolerance buy the more polished version

    of those products (that may turn out to be almost everyone)
4.  do it again and again, building a 40 percent profit margin into the products to pay the

    bills

## abundance thinking

1. if it’s digital, sooner or later it’s going to be free
2. atoms would like to be free, too, but they’re not so pushy about it
3. you can't stop free
4. you can make money from free
5. redefine your market
6. round down
7. sooner or later you will compete with free
8. embrace waste
9. free makes other things more valuable
10. manage for abundance, not scarcity

> give away 95% of your product to sell 5%
