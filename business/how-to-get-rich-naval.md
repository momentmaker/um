# how to get rich

### Seek Wealth, Not Money or Status

* Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep
* Wealth buys your freedom
* Money is how we transfer wealth
* Status is your rank in the social hierarchy
* Status is a very old game
* People creating wealth will always be attacked by people playing status games

### Make Abundance for the World

* Ethical wealth creation makes abundance for the world
* Everyone can be rich

### Free Markets Are Intrinsic to Humans

* Free markets are intrinsic to the human species
* Too many takers and not enough makers will plunge a society into ruin

### Making Money Isn’t About Luck

* Making money isn’t about luck
* 4 Kinds of Luck:
  * **1. Blind luck**
  * **2. Luck from hustling**
  * **3. Luck from preparation**
  * **4. Luck from your unique character**
* In 1,000 parallel universes, you want to be wealthy in 999 of them
* Wealth stacks up one chip at a time, not all at once

### Make Luck Your Destiny

* Build your character so opportunity finds you
* You have to be a little eccentric to be out on the frontier by yourself

### You Won’t Get Rich Renting Out Your Time

* You won’t get rich renting out your time
* Renting out your time means you’re essentially replaceable
* You must own equity to gain your financial freedom

### Live Below Your Means for Freedom

* People living below their means have freedom
* The most dangerous things are heroin and a monthly salary
* Ideally, you’ll make your money in discrete lumps

### Give Society What It Doesn’t Know How to Get

* Give society what it wants, but doesn’t know how to get—at scale
* Figure out what product you can provide and then figure out how to scale it

### The Internet Has Massively Broadened Career Possibilities

* The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers
* The Internet allows you to scale any niche obsession
* Escape competition through authenticity

### Play Long-term Games With Long-term People

* Play long-term games with long-term people
* When you switch industries, you’re starting over from scratch
* Long-term players make each other rich
* Returns come from compound interest in iterated games

### Pick Partners With Intelligence, Energy and Integrity

* Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy and integrity
* Motivation has to come intrinsically
* Integrity is what someone does, despite what they say they do

### Partner With Rational Optimists

* Don’t partner with pessimists
* Partner with rational optimists
* We’re descended from pessimists
* BOCTAOE

### Arm Yourself With Specific Knowledge

* Arm yourself with specific knowledge
* Specific knowledge can’t be trained
* Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your curiosity
* Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you

### Specific Knowledge Is Highly Creative or Technical

* Specific knowledge can be taught through apprenticeships
* Specific knowledge is often highly creative or technical
* Specific knowledge is specific to the individual and situation
* You can’t be too deliberate about assembling specific knowledge
* Build specific knowledge where you are a natural

### Learn to Sell, Learn to Build

* Learn to sell, learn to build
* The Silicon Valley model is a builder and seller
* If you can do both you will be unstoppable
* I’d rather teach an engineer marketing than a marketer engineering

**Read What You Love Until You Love to Read**

* Read what you love until you love to read
* Read the original scientific books in a field
* Don’t fear any book
* The means of learning are abundant, the desire to learn is scarce

### The Foundations Are Math and Logic

* The ultimate foundations are math and logic
* It’s better to read a great book really slowly than to fly through a hundred books quickly
* Learn persuasion and programming

### There’s No Actual Skill Called “Business”

* There’s no actual skill called “business”
* Doing is faster than watching
* The number of “doing” iterations drives the learning curve
* If you’re willing to bleed a little every day, you may win big later

### Embrace Accountability to Get Leverage

* You have to have accountability to get leverage
* Take business risks under your own name
* A well-functioning team has clear accountability for each position
* People who can fail in public have a lot of power

### Take Accountability to Earn Equity

* Accountability is how you’re going to get equity
* Taking accountability is like taking equity in all your work
* Accountability is reputational skin in the game

### Labor and Capital Are Old Leverage

* Our brains aren’t evolved to comprehend new forms of leverage
* Society overvalues labor leverage
* You want the minimum amount of labor that allows you to use the other forms of leverage
* Capital has been the dominant form of leverage in the last century
* You need specific knowledge and accountability to obtain capital

### Product and Media are New Leverage

* Product and media are the new leverage
* Product leverage is where the new fortunes are made
* Combining all three forms of leverage is a magic combination
* Product and media leverage are permissionless
* The robot army is already here—code lets you tell them what to do

### Product Leverage is Egalitarian

* Product leverage is a positive sum game
* Status goods are limited to a few people
* The best products tend to be targeted at the middle class
* Creating wealth with product leads to more ethical wealth
* You want to use the product that is used by the most people
* Capital and labor are becoming permissionless

### Pick a Business Model With Leverage

* Scale economies: the more you produce, the cheaper it gets
* Zero marginal cost of reproduction: producing more is free
* Network effect businesses are natural monopolies
* In a network effect, each new user adds value to the existing users
* Zero marginal cost businesses can pivot into network effect businesses

### Example: From Laborer to Entrepreneur

* Laborers get paid hourly and have low accountability
* General contractors get equity, but they’re also taking risk
* Property developers pocket the profit by applying capital leverage
* Architects, large developers and REITs are even higher in the stack
* Real estate tech companies apply the maximum leverage

### Judgment Is the Decisive Skill

* In an age of infinite leverage, judgment becomes the most important skill
* Everything else you do is setting you up to apply judgment
* Judgment is knowing the long-term consequences of your actions
* Without experience, judgment is often less than useless
* The people with the best judgment are among the least emotional
* A lot of the top investors often sound like philosophers
* The more outraged someone is, the worse their judgment

### Set an Aspirational Hourly Rate

* Set and enforce an aspirational hourly rate
* You can’t penny pinch your way to wealth
* My aspirational rate was $5,000/hr
* If you can outsource something for less than your hourly rate, do it
* Your hourly rate should seem absurdly high

### Work As Hard As You Can

* Work as hard as you can
* What you work on and who you work with are more important
* Nobody really works 80 hours a week
* Inspiration is perishable
* Impatience with actions, patience with results

### Be Too Busy to “Do Coffee”

* Be too busy to “do coffee” while keeping an uncluttered calendar
* People will meet with you when you have proof of work
* Networking is overrated even early in your career

### Keep Redefining What You Do

* Keep redefining what you do until you’re the best at what you do
* Find founder-product-market fit

### Escape Competition Through Authenticity

* Competition will trap you in a lesser game
* No one can compete with you on being you
* In entrepreneurship, the masses are never right
* Combine your vocation and avocation

### Play Stupid Games, Win Stupid Prizes

* Businesses that seem like they’re in direct competition really aren’t
* My first company got caught up in the wrong game

### Eventually You Will Get What You Deserve

* On a long enough time scale you will get paid
* What are you really good at that the market values?

### Reject Most Advice

* The best founders listen to everyone but make up their own mind
* Advice is maxims you can recall later, when you get your own experience

### A Calm Mind, a Fit Body, a House Full of Love

* When you’re wealthy, you’ll realize it wasn’t what you were seeking
* A calm mind, a fit body and a house full of love must be earned
* Practical advice for a calmer internal state
* A lot of divorces happen over money, a lot of battles happen over internal anger

### There Are No Get Rich Quick Schemes

* There are no get rich quick schemes
* We don’t have ads because it would ruin our credibility
* Anyone giving advice on how to get rich should have made their money elsewhere

### Productize Yourself

* Figure out what you’re uniquely good at and apply as much leverage as possible&#x20;
* Find hobbies that make you rich, fit and creative
