# the inevitable

the only constant is change

### Becoming

* technology is always changing, hard to predict what will come from it
* the most important thing that came out from the last century is scientific method which became the process/blueprint to create all these new inventions
* no one cared to buy domains when the internet was in the early stages
* new frontiers will always be there. in 2016, whatever invented will be akin to domains back in the days looking back from 2050

### Cognifying

* "Google is an AI company, not a search company" - Brin at a party before its IPO
* when electricity was discovered, the business model is taking a tool and electrify it
* now it's _take x and add AI_
* cognified - music, laundry, marketing, real estate, nursing, construction, ethics, toys, sports, knitting, etc.
* AI breakthroughs now because we have: cheap parallel computation, big data, and better algorithms
* robots will blend into ours lives and take away old jobs but new jobs will be created
  * jobs humans can do but robots can do even better
  * jobs humans can't do but robots can
  * jobs we didn't know we wanted done
  * jobs only humans can do - at first

### Flowing

* internet is like world's largest copy machine and copies will flow freely through the network forever
* humans like to create based on what we know
  * initial computers had a "desktop" with "folders" and "files"
  * then the web turned it into a "browser" with "pages"
  * now we have a "stream" with "channels", adding "tags", "likes", only present, no past or future
* first industry disrupted by this was music
* universal law of economics - the moment something becomes free and ubiquitous, its position in the economic equation suddenly inverts
  * electrical lighting was new and scarce, the poor burned candles
  * electricity became common and almost free, candles became a sign of luxury
* what can't be copied? **Trust**
* add generative qualities to the free product:
  * immediacy
  * personalization
  * interpretation
  * authenticity
  * accessibility
  * embodiment
  * patronage
  * discoverability
* 4 stages of flowing:
  * fixed / rare
  * free / ubiquitous
  * flowing / sharing
  * opening / becoming

### Screening

* from people of the word -> people of the book -> people of the screen
* books will be linked like the web (sort of like wikipedia)
* universal library like the library of alexandria
* the screens will become smaller and smaller

### Accessing

* from noun to verb, product to service, ownership to rental
* 5 deep technological trends:
  * dematerialization - software eats the world, SaaS
  * real-time on demand - rethink the ways to service, uber for X
  * decentralization - bitcoin
  * platform synergy - apple appstore, software ecosystems
  * clouds - dynamically distributed, final step: decentralized access (the cloud)

### Sharing

* digital social-ism - collaborative filtering and promote the best stuff
* 4 steps of social arrangements
  * sharing - youtube, pinterest, foursquare, yelp
  * cooperation - creative commons, tags
  * collaboration - open source softwares and hardwares
  * collectivism - openhub.net all work for free, paid by being allowed to stay in the commune
* google, facebook, twitter all benefited hugely from sharing
* _bottom up is not enough_, top down is needed too
* wikipedia, linux - only a small amount of elites get to make the big decisions
* hive-mind is good enough and scales up nicely
* crowd-funding for anything

### Filtering

* filters exist today: gatekeepers, intermediates, curators, brands, government, our cultural environment, our friends, ourselves
* danger of being rewarded with only what you like, filter bubble - "overfitting"
* suggest stuff that I don't like but would like to like
* large-scale personalization is coming for the masses (pills, clothing)
* in the future, people can copy your filter/recommendation and you'd get monetary value
* too much data, limited attention - the only scarce thing now
* attention is rather cheap (around $3/hr) since you always need to spend it
* google, facebook used data to match ads to users wonderfully with a bidding system
* new model could be - p2p ad creation network, pinterest like ads curation where the curator gets paid in microtransaction per view
* more things are being commoditized and decreasing in value but the experience economy is vibrant

### Remixing

* golden age of new mediums - remix out of old genres
* new genres -> remixed, unbundled, recombined into new genres
* upsetting the great asymmetry in all media - easier to read a book than to write, listen than compose, view than produce
* lucas changed the way movies are made from scenes shot to mock slowly edited bit by bit
  * every scene is touched by digital manipulation
  * more in common with the way books are written, paintings are painted
* books are references and citations but movies are still lacking that
  * how to browse a film the way we browse a book?
  * video summary (from porn invention)
  * video findability is the holy grail - google is working on that by training AI to recognize photos which makes up a video
  * rewindability is another ongoing revolution - shift from orals to books, now happening to movies, music, games and more
* material to intangible brings into question what ownership is
  * house can only owned by one person, an idea can only be copied
  * laws will be lagging behind but will follow suits to technology

### Interacting

* vr was first started in 1980s but never took off
* timothy leary compared vr to lsd
* vr's two benefits: _presence and interaction_
* eventually imax's cinema could be projected to your eyes with certain positioning of lighting
* from second life -> minecraft because too much computing power in the former game
* nano cameras to track your eye movement and displayed in vr environment
* eye tracking for auto-annotation if one gets stuck or auto-forward in a video if bored
* "trouble with computer is there's not enough africa in them"
* embed microphones, cameras and sensors to use your whole body as a controller
* eventually if something is not interactive, it's broken
* interaction expansion:
  * more senses
  * more intimacy
  * more immersion
* vr world is under total surveillance, everything needs to be tracked
* identity will be an issue in the future
* your body will be your password - typing, heartbeat, gait, blink, voice - interaction as a password

### Tracking

* "quantified self" meetup where everything imaginable is tracked
* personally medicine maker box is possible with tracking
* evolve our senses with tracking
* track and share your lifestreams
* lifelogging with narrative clip to take photos every few moments
* audio lifelogging is better than visual
* every car manufactured after 2006 has a tiny obd chip mounted to track miles, speed, braking, etc.
* tracking will follow the same way of accessing - any data can be tracked, will be tracked
* ubiquitous tracking is inevitable
* government is tracking but doing it secretly which needs to be transparent
* vanity trumps privacy
* anonymity is like toxic substances. shouldn't be eliminated since it sustains life but should as close to zero as possible
* giga -> tera -> peta -> exa -> zetta -> yotta -> "unknown"
* there is a large magnitude of orders between each
* 54 billion sensors every year by 2020

### Questioning

* wikipedia and ebay shouldn't be possible but did
* criminals will use creative ways to use the new tools
* future will be streams of only the impossible moments
* interwoven between work and play online - a waking dream of sort
* more advanced tools answer questions but more questions pop out from the answer
* we really don't know much about the universe at all
* question <> answer paradigm is shifted - answers are a commodity now
* a good question is worth a million good answers
* quality of a good question:
  * not concerned with a correct answer
  * cannot be answered immediately
  * challenges existing answers
  * one you badly want answered once you hear it, but had no inkling you cared before it was asked
  * creates new territory of thinking
  * reframes its own answers
  * is the seed of innovation in science, technology, art, politics, and business
  * is a probe, a what-if scenario
  * skirts on the edge of what is known and not known, neither silly nor obvious
  * cannot be predicted
  * will be the sign of an educated mind
  * is one that generates many other good questions
  * may be the last job a machine will learn to do
  * is what humans are for

### Beginning

* a cycle - a century-long process
* global system will not be utopia - will be like real-life with classes
* we are in the beginning right now with the shift from centralized to decentralized
* singularity - a frontier beyond which nothing can be known
  * "hard" - super ai learns everything there is to know and take over
  * "soft" - a complex interdependence
